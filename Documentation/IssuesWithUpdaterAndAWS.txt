Problems:

        1) AWS AMI's are updated on Launch, therefor there is a need for Periodic Re-Launch!

        2) If on Launch, the Updater can not reach the Web Source for its dependencies, the Launch will fail.

Solutions:

        a) Launch Image needs to be provided with all its dependencies.

        b) Updater proceeds if Everything There, & Can't talk to Web Source.

        c) API based AMI Launcher & Re-Imager (to snag an Updated and dependency resolved Image).
